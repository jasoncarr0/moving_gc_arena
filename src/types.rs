/**
 * A raw index for a region, that should be used for internal edges.
 * 
 * This index is invalidated by many operations. but locations which
 * have always been exposed exactly once by foreach_ix for each collection are
 * guaranteed to have an index which is valid.
 *
 * Furthermore, indices received from a MutEntry or Root/Weak are
 * valid when retrieved.
 *
 * An Ix is valid so long as no invalidating methods have been called.
 * Borrowing rules ensure several situations in which no invalidating method can be called:
 *  - An immutable reference to the region exists
 *  - A mutable or immutable reference to any element of this region exists, such as those
 *    acquired via Ix::get.
 *  - A MutEntry for this region exists.
 *
 * If an Ix is not valid for the given region, behavior is unspecified but safe,
 * A valid instance of T may be returned. Panics may occur with get and get_mut.
 * If the index is valid, then it still points to the expected object.
